any time, but in apple-blossom time it is adorable;
a riot of blossom everywhere, of purest white,
cream and shell pink, and, in the midst of it all
in a little hollow or dip in the road one comes
upon the tiny village of Grand Pré&mdash;straggling
down a gentle slope to the basin of Minas. In
the Spring the village is almost buried in blossom,
and so peaceful now, tho&#8217; the scene of so much
sorrow and tragedy in the past, of which one is
reminded by Evangeline&#8217;s Well, and an old stone
cross, which marks the site where the village
once stood. A picturesque row of ancient willows,
planted by the Acadians, helps to bring
back the pathos and tragedy of that time even
now.</p>

<span class="i0">&#8220;Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that perhaps in its bosom</span>
<span class="i1">He was already at rest; and she longed to slumber beside him.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Grand-Pré, the home of Evangeline, seldom
fails to impress the stranger, who sees it for
the first time, with a sense of its rich loveliness.
It would be difficult to find a more delightful
setting for the story of the Acadian maiden, separated
from her betrothed lover, Gabriel, and sent into exile
with her people.</p>

<p>The country fronting the present Grand-Pré is
broadly open to the Basin of Minas. The dyked
marshes extend for miles in blocks of pasture, grain,
and haylands. Great creeks which once the mighty
tides of the Bay of Fundy filled till the meadows were
submerged with the turbid waters; red channels of the
winding rivers beyond; and the great stretch of the
Basin of Minas, purple-fringed by the distant hills, all
combine to make this an idyllic setting.</p>

<p>At the time of the Deportation of the Acadians, in
1755, most of the farm land, flanked by the dyked
meadows, from the Gaspereau River to Kentville, held
the villages and small hamlets of the people. Upon the
descending slopes on both sides of the Gaspereau Val<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>ley
that lies south of Grand-Pré, other populous villages,
pastures and farms, clustered as far as the
present village of the name, Gaspereau.</p>

<p>North and west, as far as Pereau, under the North
Mountain, the rich Acadian country of Canard lay upon
the banks of the four rivers, fronting always the meadows
of marsh that spread away from the swift tidal
streams.</p>

<p>This was the Minas country of the Acadian period,
divided into two parishes, Grand-Pré and Canard,
separated by the present Cornwallis River. In 1750,
five years before the removal of the inhabitants, Minas
had a population of four thousand. There were thirty-five
villages, named after the original founders who
came from Port Royal&mdash;Gaspereau and Grand-Pré
were the only exceptions.</p>

<p>Upon the Grand-Pré meadows may be seen the
thirteen sections of dykes raised from time to time,
till the whole extent of marsh became enclosed. It
was a laborious work for the people, who numbered
only four hundred in 1700. Most of the marshes were
enclosed during the following forty years as the families
grew to manhood, and new settlers came. Upon
these lands they had their pastures, hay and grain
areas fenced in. Upon the undyked marshes they cut
the coarse salt grass.</p>

<p>As the forest lands were cleared of wood, they were
used as pastures. Beyond these, stretched the primeval
forests on all sides. Orchards of apple and
pear, and garden plots lay near the homes. Fish were
abundant in the sea beyond. By boat the settlers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
able to pass from place to place, for the rivers made
convenient ways for travel.</p>

<h3>Grand Pré</h3>

<p>While the name Grand-Pré was given in general to
the Minas country south and alongside the Cornwallis
River, the village of the name was adjoining the Memorial
Park land. It had twenty-three inhabitants living
upon three farms. The cellars of the three homes
may be seen to-day. The largest was on the west side
of the Park. The other two, upon the gentle slope
south. They were the properties of Pierre Landry,
Jean le Sour, and Jacques Terriot&mdash;all prominent and
prosperous men in the little community.</p>

<p>The knoll of land, consisting of fourteen acres, now
called the Grand-Pré Memorial or Historical Park, lies
adjoining the dyked lands. It is enclosed by a rustic
fence, and is separated by the Dominion Atlantic Railway
from the farms on the slope rising to the south.
The ground was used for church purposes, and the
chapel stood upon the highest part of the knoll. Where
the stone cross stands was the burying ground of the
Grand-Pré Acadians of the parish of St. Charles.
The church land had been given for the purpose by the
original Landry, and formed part of his farm. About
the year 1687, the first church was built, and enlarged
or rebuilt as the population increased. Few dykes had
been erected at this time, and the tides of the Basin of
Minas came within a few hundred feet of the church
land. In the burying ground were laid the first to die
in Minas. Melansons, Terriots, Le Blancs, Landrys,
and other families mingle their dust there. The cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
without names, built of stone from some of their home
foundations, marks where they lie forgotten.</p>

<p>The Presbytery stood on the foundation west of
the church site. This was occupied by Colonel Winslow
when his troops were encamped about the churchyard,
on the eve of the Deportation. The row of willows
on the north side of the Park grounds was set out
to shield the church from the north winds that swept
across the open dyked lands.</p>

<p>The bronze figure of Evangeline (<a href="#Fig_12"><i>facing p. 72</i></a>),
represented as looking back upon the country of her
people as she set out to depart with them from Grand-Pré,
will always typify the Deportation of the Acadians,
the commencement of the period of exile and wandering.
The statue stands upon the old road by which
the people reached the church, and is but the commencement
of restoration work projected for the Historical
Park at Grand-Pré. (At the summit of the
slope south this road joined the main highway running
from the Gaspereau River to the farther villages of
the Acadians.) The statue was modelled by Philippe
Hebert, himself a descendant of the Acadian family of
the name. Etienne Hebert was one of the first colonists
to come to the Minas country from the home
colony of Port Royal, now Annapolis Royal. This
family increased in numbers in Minas, and two villages
bore the name, one in Minas and the other in Canard.
There were fifty Heberts at the time of the dispersion.</p>

<p>We may now review the growth of the Acadian
Minas from the coming of the first settlers in 1681 to
the year 1755, when Colonel John Winslow, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
New England volunteers, encamped upon the church
ground of St. Charles at Grand-Pré. In December of
that year the houses and barns, churches and mills of
the Acadians were destroyed, and for five years the
country was without an inhabitant. We have the
names of the older parents, of their children, their possessions.
We also have record of the younger married
couples who came to make homes in the new country
of Minas. The villages grew chiefly in clusters about
the establishments of the elders. Dykes were built.
Land was cleared of wood for their gardens and
orchards. Roads were made connecting all the centres
of farm life. Winter roads for their timber, fencing,
and firewood were made. Finally, they cut a way
through the forests from Halifax to Annapolis Royal.
They were increasing in population, and in worldly
goods.</p>

<h3>The Three First Families</h3>

<p>Perhaps before entering directly upon the historical
aspects of the Evangeline country, it would be interesting
to know something of its outstanding families,
members of which figured prominently in the later
history of the place.</p>

<p>The three most picturesque and important persons
in the history of the Minas country are Pierre Melanson,
Pierre Terriot, and René LeBlanc.</p>

<h3>The Melansons (Gaspereau)</h3>

<p>In a census of the Port Royal people, made in 1671,
the name Pierre Melanson appears, but with no account
of his family or possessions. He refused to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
facts asked for. There has been some doubt as to his
antecedents, although he was a man of importance, and
his name appears in several historical documents. Some
think he was the son of the Scotchman, Pierre Melanson,
who remained in Acadia after the colony under
Sir William Alexander was broken up in 1632.</p>

<p>It has been ascertained, however, that Pierre Melanson
was a tailor and farmer of considerable wealth,
when he sold his Port Royal property in 1669. He was
also Captain of militia, and a man of mark among the
oldest inhabitants of that place. His courage and
enterprise are shown by his removal to the unsettled
country of Minas in 1681. His selection of the Gaspereau
Valley for his new home, points to a knowledge
of the country, for he settled in the most beautiful and
favorable situation in the region. It was at the head
of the tide, sheltered, with extensive marshes, and rich
uplands suitable for farming. The forests lay upon
the hills, the stream teemed with gasperot, salmon,
and trout. The Basin of Minas could be easily reached
at high tide by boat. Conditions were most favorable
for the development of the little colony, and those
which soon sprang up in that neighbourhood (Gaspereau)
and at Grand-Pré.</p>

<p>The Gaspereau villages grew in importance, and
were among the richest and most populous in 1755.
The Melansons numbered about eighty souls, and were
connected by kinship and marriage with all the Acadian
families of Minas.</p>

<p>It was one of the daughters of this Pierre Melanson
who married the &#8220;Notary Public&#8221; of Longfellow&#8217;s
Evangeline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,</span>
<span class="i1">Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;</span>
<span class="i1">Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maise, hung</span>
<span class="i1">Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; glasses with horn bows</span>
<span class="i1">Sat astride his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal.</span>
<span class="i1">Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred</span>
<span class="i1">Children&#8217;s children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Another daughter, Anne, married Thomas Jacasse,
and it was their son who later refused to sign the deliberations
for the surrender of Quebec.</p>

<h3>The Terriots (The Cornwallis)</h3>

<p>The next colonist who came to establish himself in
Minas was Pierre Terriot from Port Royal. He is an
important and interesting figure in the history of the
country. His coming dates but a short time after
Pierre Melanson&#8217;s arrival. Terriot selected the fine
situation near Kentville, upon the present Cornwallis
River, with natural conditions similar to the Gaspereau
Valley. Good upland for farms, and extensive areas of
marsh near the head of the tidal stream, afforded
favorable means for the development of his farming
operations. His home on the south side of the river
was ten miles from Melanson&#8217;s, and the expansion of
growth was each toward the other. The farm areas
soon extended alongside the marshes into what became
the Grand-Pré district.</p>

<p>Pierre Terriot, like Melanson, came out from Port
Royal, where his father had settled before him. Port
Royal was the parent colony (1632, under Commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Razilly) from which all the Acadian districts received
their first colonists.</p>

<p>Pierre Terriot was a colonizer, and an interesting
figure in the early days of Minas. Although he had no
children by his wife Cécile Landry, he encouraged
migration from Port Royal to the wilderness, the rich
country of Minas that surrounded him. Young couples
soon came, relatives of the Terriots and Landrys, and
others, who for a time enlarged their holdings more
rapidly than those who came to Grand-Pré and Gaspereau.
The founder, Terriot, who was in good circumstances,
aided the newcomers with grain and stock,
and as has always been the custom of the Acadians, the
settled people cut the timber, built the foundations and
homes, and helped the young couples to start in life.</p>

<p>Pierre Terriot&#8217;s home was, moreover, the asylum for
orphans and widows, till the children grew up and were
able to set up for themselves. The settlers married
young, and were encouraged to do so, for they were
a home-loving people, and industrious.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Their dwellings were open as day, and the hearts of the owners;</span>
<span class="i1">Where the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Terriots numbered about fifty, and were also
settled in other parts of Nova Scotia. This region
seemed to attract the younger people from the older
and more thickly settled country of Port Royal. It was
favorably situated, more remote from the New England
colonies, and so conditioned that all who came
could acquire land and make homes.</p>

The Old Port Royal</p>

<p class="caption">At Annapolis Royal&mdash;once the busy capital&mdash;one
is struck by the peace and content which seems to
reign everywhere, and perhaps the most peaceful
spot is amongst the grass-grown ramparts of the
old Fort&mdash;softened and rounded by time, and in
summer carpeted with wild flowers. A magnificent
sweep of the wide river mouth lies in front,
and the Fort, built on a high bluff, looks over the
valleys of the Lequille and Annapolis Rivers on
either hand. The buildings still standing are the
officers&#8217; quarters, which are interesting, and no
doubt were considered luxurious in those days,
and the old powder magazine, built nearly three
centuries ago, and still in excellent repair. A
horrible dark dungeon, chill and damp, is built
under the ramparts at one angle, and the picturesque
sally port is still much as it was in olden
days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Next to the Grand-Pré Park land, the New Minas
relics of the Terriot settlements and the work of their
descendants are the most numerous and interesting.
Many cellar foundations remain as they were left in
1755 after the houses and barns were burned. The
English colonists of 1760 raised their houses farther
away from the marshes, so that the Terriot landmarks
for the greater part still remain undisturbed. Some of
their houses were forty-five feet square, with huge
chimneys built outside ten feet square at the ground,
traces of which still remain.</p>

<h3>The Le Blancs (Grand-Pré)</h3>

<p>Among the later arrivals were the Le Blancs, whose
children added considerably to the growth of population,
and whose importance and prosperity make them
outstanding persons in the country.</p>

<p>The first Le Blanc was Daniel, born in France in
1626. Thousands of his descendants are to be found
in America to-day. He arrived in Acadia in 1650, with
his wife, Françoise Gaudet. He settled in Port Royal
about nine miles above the fort. When that place fell
to the English under Phipps, in 1690, Le Blanc was
among those appointed to administer the affairs of the
Province until the arrival of a Governor. His name is
found on the census of 1671, 1686, and 1693. He had
probably died before the next census in 1698, as his
name does not appear then or afterwards. He lived
to be about seventy years old, in spite of the trying
and laborious period through which the people of
Acadia lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
The four sons of the first Port Royal Le Blanc settled
upon the present Grand-Pré lands very soon after
Melanson had become established on the Gaspereau
and Terriot on the Cornwallis.</p>

<p>The village, Jean Le Blanc, in 1775, had eight
families. Village Pierre Le Blanc had fourteen, and
Grand Le Blanc had thirteen. The Le Blancs appeared
also in other villages.</p>

<p>This family was related to all the older stock of
Acadian families, to be found in 1755 throughout the
whole of settled Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>The history of Grand-Pré, by which is meant, the
annals of the country contiguous to the Memorial Park,
the Grand-Pré of the present day, in a sense, is the
family history of the Le Blancs. One member of the
family, René, was an historical character.</p>

<h3>Other Names</h3>

years after Pierre Melanson&#8217;s advent to the Gaspereau,

are mentioned with particulars of their worldly condition
and size of family.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three of the Minas inhabitants mentioned on the
1686 list, de la Bove, la Pierre, and Rivet, were newcomers
to Acadia, and for some reason failed to make
headway in the country. Their descendants were few,
and the names disappear from the annals.</p>

<h3>The Canard District</h3>

<p>The Melansons&#8217;, Terriots&#8217;, and Le Blancs&#8217; holdings
all extended east or west, south of the Cornwallis
River. North of this stream, another section was expanding,
but more slowly, although conditions were
favorable there for colonization.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the Canard region become populated, crossings
were made to reach the villages at low tide over the
Cornwallis River. A road was made connecting the
up-river settlements with Grand-Pré to the Gaspereau,
where the principal centre of Minas developed, with its
church, its protected landing-place and port for vessels,
its store-house, and the office of the Deputy, where
deeds and important documents were kept.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus Canard grew, and finally a beautiful church
was built there. The Cornwallis River divided the
parishes of Canard and Grand-Pré, but the whole
region was rapidly growing in population and wealth,
till it was entering upon the period preceding the Deportation.
A thousand Acadians departed from Minas
about 1750, so that in 1755 there were about three
thousand remaining in the two parishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<h3>Leading Up to the Expulsion</h3>

<p>The French colonists of Nova Scotia were constantly
subjected to attacks by British colonial forces.
In 1613, Port Royal, again in 1654, La Have, and in
1700, Minas were razed and completely destroyed by
these armies. The older Acadians and their sons,
accustomed to the conditions of the country, quickly
recovered from these attacks. The later comers, however,
were not so well fitted to cope with the difficulties
of the new life, and the new names died out or did not
increase so quickly as the original stock, the hardy,
thrifty peasantry from the west coast of France.</p>

<p>These repeated expeditions against the French
colonies were the outcome of strong inimical feeling
both at home and abroad. The British colonies of
America greatly outnumbered the French of Canada
and the Province, and the desire to remove the
Acadians from the peninsula, and thus break the backbone
of the French colonial enterprise, had been growing
for several years.</p>

<p>This sorry task finally fell to the lot of Lieutenant-Colonel
Winslow, under the specific orders of Governor
Lawrence of Halifax. In August, 1755, he came with
three hundred men, and in conjunction with Captain
Murray, then in command of Fort Edward, arranged
the details for the capture and removal of the people.</p>

<p>At the time of Winslow&#8217;s arrival with his troops in
ships, the priests of Grand-Pré and Canard had been
removed to Halifax as prisoners. All the guns owned
by the Acadians had been seized, yet the coming of the
troops and their use of the church and burying-grounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
as an encampment did not arouse suspicion as to the
purpose of the visit. The people had frequently seen
both French and English soldiers quartered in their
country.</p>

<p>The Acadians were gathering their harvests when
Winslow arrived from Cumberland and marched from
Gaspereau Landing to the church at Grand-Pré. As
we read his own account of that stay, we realize his
repugnance at the harsh duty before him&mdash;the task of
using military force to expel a quiet, happy people
from its home-place&mdash;particularly in the face of the
total inadequacy of ships provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>As the winter set in, the miseries of the people
bore heavily upon him, and his feeling in the matter is
thinly concealed in the account of the affair as set down
in his Journal.</p>

<p>From this same Journal we learn that he used the
Presbytery as his headquarters, and that in the churchyard
the tents of the soldiers were pitched; that the
camp was protected by a pallisade, and that full military
discipline was enforced.</p>

<h3>The Deportation</h3>

<p>The poem, Evangeline, tells the story of the 5th of
September, 1755, and what followed.</p>

<p>As the crops were to be gathered early in that dry
year, this date was fixed upon for summoning the men
and boys of the district to the church to receive their
brutal orders&mdash;to hear the proclamation declaring
them prisoners of the Crown; their homes, their lands,
their holdings, confiscate. It was a bitter time for both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
those who spoke and heard. It is not difficult to imagine
the emotion of Lieutenant-Colonel Winslow, as he delivered
his blighting message of exile to these strong
sunburnt fathers and sons of Minas, anxiously waiting
his words.</p>

<p>When Winslow departed from Grand-Pré in November,
all the outlying villages had been destroyed.
Canard&#8217;s church, the mills, houses, and barns were in
ashes. Except for the shelterless animals that wandered
about close upon starvation, nothing remained.
The inhabitants, carrying with them as many of their
household effects as the weather and the cramped
accommodations of the ships would permit, had gone.
A pitiful season followed. The pathetic scenes of the
deportation are almost indescribable. Through military
necessity, perhaps fear of insubordination, parent
was separated from child, lover from lover, brother
from brother. As many as possible were loaded immediately
upon the waiting vessels. Six hundred and
fifty were quartered about the villages of the Le Blancs,
three hundred of whom were embarked in December.
A week later, the remainder were sent off, and the
houses they had occupied destroyed. The church
which the soldiers had used as quarters was probably
the last building to stand.</p>

<h3>Two Interesting Incidents</h3>

<p>Two rather interesting incidents in connection with
the Deportation which have come to notice, follow.</p>

<p>Although all records of births, deaths, etc., were
destroyed or in part lost, one of the Piziquid exiles
carried the deed of his grandfather&#8217;s property with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to Philadelphia. The writer saw this document in 1920,
still held by a descendant as a precious relic.</p>

<p>René Le Blanc, mentioned above as figuring in history,
came to notice at this time in the following manner.
Winslow, evidently touched by the man&#8217;s age
and gentleness of character, made a special request to
headquarters that Le Blanc be permitted to return to
his home in Marshfield, but the old man was sent to
New York with his wife and two children, out of the
twenty of his family. His grandchildren numbered
over a hundred. Later he found three more of his
children in Philadelphia, where René died.</p>

<p>The Acadians were scattered throughout the British
colonies. A few who escaped, wandered over the
country to be later apprehended and deported. A number
more found their way unharmed into the wilderness
of New Brunswick, but by 1763 there were less
than 1,500 who had escaped the removal.</p>

<p>There is a tradition based upon traces of dwellings
found in the woods south of New Minas, that a few
escaped Acadians lived there through the following
winter. These few either were captured or later joined
those retreating into New Brunswick.</p>

<p>After the expulsion of the French settlers, Great
Britain, to induce settlers to come to the country of
Horton and Cornwallis from the older English colonies,
sent out an invitation with a description of the country:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;One hundred thousand acres, of which the country
has produced wheat, rye, barley, oats, hemp, flax, etc.,
without failure for the last century; and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
hundred thousand acres are cleared and stocked with
English grass, planted orchards and embellished with
gardens, the whole so intermixed that every individual
farmer might have a proportionate quantity of plowed
land, grassland, and woodland.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This appeared in 1759. In June, the next year, after
the country was viewed by agents from New England,
the people came to occupy the vacated lands. With
the assistance of the Acadian prisoners remaining at
Fort Edward, the dykes were repaired, and the country
began to thrive with new life upon the grave of the
old.</p>

<p>The last written trace of the Acadians in a body,
appears in an order issued from Halifax in 1762, causing
one hundred and thirty of them to be sent from
Hants and King&#8217;s counties, where they were working
for English inhabitants.</p>

<p>For the English settlers, the farm lands were divided
into hundred-acre lots. New roads were laid out, and
the old Acadian landmarks are now gradually disappearing.
A single farm to-day perhaps occupies the
site of a whole village of Acadian times. Willows still
mark roads or the buried foundations of their homes.
Their apple trees yet bear fruit, sometimes found among
the wild, recent growth, or in pastures. Roads and
dykes may be traced, and numerous cellars in out-of-the-way
places where they have not been disturbed.</p>

<p>In the history of the English colonies during the
next twenty years following upon the re-settlement of
the Acadian country of Grand-Pré, affairs went topsy-turvy.
French Canada was lost to France through
the operations and strength of the colonies under English
rule. New England strengthened Nova Scotia for
England by removing the Acadians, and then bringing
her people to the deserted farmlands.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Bear River</p>

<p class="caption">Bear River nestles deep down in a little valley
about five miles from the sea on a river from
which it takes its name. At low tide there is very
little river to be seen&mdash;it is reduced to a tiny
stream that seems to trickle with difficulty through
vast stretches of mud. But when the tide does
come up it alters the whole appearance, and the
place seems to come to life again as the strong
current pushes its way up&mdash;running far up the
little streams, and beneath the houses, which are
built out over the river bed, at the bridge, on
high wooden gates&mdash;giving a wonderfully picturesque
effect, and reflecting all shades of color.
The town scrambles up the steep hills, which rise
sharply on either side, and beautiful views of the
winding river may be seen from almost any
point, and quantities of cherry trees everywhere
add to the picturesqueness&mdash;whether in blossom
or laden with the ripe fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h3>Conclusion&mdash;Acadia Then and Now</h3>

<p>The memory of the courageous heart-high peasantry
that first peopled and made home of a wilderness,
remains fresh in the present-day Acadia.</p>

<p>The garden-plots cleared upon the uplands near
their homes, their orchards laid out in rugged rows,
still bloom for us who know that country. We still
find the roads leading to the dykes by the rivers, even
traces of the trails originally reaching back to the
wild pastures; the dykes upon which so much time and
labor were expended season after season&mdash;an arduous
work when Acadia&#8217;s population was yet so small. The
wild luxurious beauty of the place to-day, its blossoms,
its fruit, its vivid dunes, its picturesque water-ways, the
daily romance of the rushing tide for which the little
boats thirst on the sand hour by hour&mdash;bring back
afresh the quaint pictures of its early days. The quiet
grazing cattle might still be the hardy kine that lived
through those early winters on the abundant after-feed
of the settler&#8217;s dyked lands. Every aspect of the place,
the almost hidden ruins here and there, Evangeline&#8217;s
well, the rough stone cross that marks the grave of a
village, the virility of the bronze Evangeline, make real
the pathos of this people now scattered broadcast
through America, in whose souls the love of their
country, Acadia, is as potent now as then. Neither
time nor the Deportation have caused them to lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
their identity as a distinct people, for a quarter of a
million in America are the same Acadians who went
into exile from Nova Scotia from 1755 to 1763.</p>

<h3>The Origin of &#8220;Evangeline&#8221;</h3>

<p>There is a close connection between the story which
supplied the basis of the poem, Evangeline, and the
Acadian people. In 1838, Hawthorne entered in his
Note-Books the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;H. L. C.&mdash;Heard from a French-Canadian a story
of a young couple in Acadie. On their marriage day
all the men of the Province were summoned to assemble
in the church to hear a proclamation. When assembled,
they were seized and shipped off to be distributed
through New England, among them the new bridegroom.
His bride set off in search of him, wandered
about New England all her lifetime, and at last found
her bridegroom on his deathbed. The shock was so
great it killed her likewise.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Longfellow&#8217;s final decision to adopt the name
Evangeline for his poem, rather than Gabrielle (which
was the name of the heroine of Mrs. Williams&#8217; story
of &#8220;The Acadian Exile&#8221;) has given existence to a character
that will live for all time.</p>

<h3>Origin of Names in &#8220;Evangeline&#8221;</h3>

<p>Another name to be perpetuated by history is
Acadie, or Acadia as it is known at the present time.
Whether we accept the statement or not that the Italian
navigator, Verrazano, who explored the American
coast as far as New York, called the country &#8220;Arcadie&#8221;,
because of the magnificence of the trees, there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
preference for the Micmac Indian origin of the name,
&#8220;Acadie.&#8221; The country was visited by Breton and
Basque fishermen a hundred years before the settlement
of Port Royal in 1605. From that time the Maritime
countries of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and
part of the State of Maine, were named Acadie. Many
places to-day retain their original Micmac names. We
have Benacadie, Katakaddy, Shubenacadie, Shunacadie,
with the meaning, &#8220;abundance of,&#8221; or &#8220;the place
of&#8221; certain things. As we know, Nova Scotia is in
truth Acadie.</p>

<p>The Bay of Fundy comes from &#8220;au fond du Baie,&#8221;
as the Port Royal people designated the head of that
great tidal stream. The discovery of native copper and
coal led to the naming of the headland at the upper
end of the Bay of Fundy, &#8220;Les Mines.&#8221; This name was
extended to designate the country about the Basin of
Minas connected by Minas Channel with the great Bay.</p>

<p>Grand-Pré and Canard, the original names of the
Acadian period, are still used to distinguish the townships
of Horton and Cornwallis. The Gaspereau River
and Valley, New Minas, Habitant and Pereau, remain
the memories of the Acadian period.</p>

at low tide even the smallest boat can scarcely
pass. There is a fascination, too, in the tides,
as they race over the great flat stretches&mdash;a
steady onward flow, swift and relentless, till the
water once more washes round the crumbling
sandstone cliffs, floating the laden schooners and
the tiny fishing boats which hurry away on the

<span class="i0">In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,<span class="linenum">20</span></span>
<span class="i0">Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-Pré</span>
<span class="i0">Lay in the fruitful valley. Vast meadows stretched to the eastward,</span>
<span class="i0">Giving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without number.</span>
<span class="i0">Dikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised with labour incessant,</span>

<span class="i0">Opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o&#8217;er the meadows.</span>
<span class="i0">West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and cornfields</span>
<span class="i0">Spreading afar and unfenced o&#8217;er the plain; and away to the northward</span>
<span class="i0">Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains</span>
<span class="i0">Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic<span class="linenum">30</span></span>
<span class="i0">Looked on the happy valley, but ne&#8217;er from their station descended.</span>
<span class="i0">There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village.</span>
<span class="i0">Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of hemlock,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows; and gables projecting<span class="linenum">35</span></span>

<span class="i0">Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics.</span>
<span class="i0">Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;<span class="linenum">55</span></span>

<span class="i0">Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,</span>
<span class="i0">Built o&#8217;er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary.</span>
<span class="i0">Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown<span class="linenum">90</span></span>
<span class="i0">Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses.</span>
<span class="i0">Shielding the house from storms, on the north, were the barns and the farm-yard;</span>
<span class="i0">There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows;</span>
<span class="i0">There were the folds for the sheep; and there, in his feathered seraglio,</span>
<span class="i0">Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the selfsame<span class="linenum">95</span></span>
<span class="i0">Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter.</span>
<span class="i0">Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village. In each one</span>
<span class="i0">Far o&#8217;er the gable projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase,</span>
<span class="i0">Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the odorous corn-loft.</span>
<span class="i0">There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent inmates<span class="linenum">100</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Murmuring ever of love; while above in the variant breezes</span>
<span class="i0">Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of Grand-Pré</span>
<span class="i0">Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline governed his household.</span>
<span class="i0">Many a youth, as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,<span class="linenum">105</span></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion;</span>
<span class="i0">Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment!</span>
<span class="i0">Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness befriended,</span>
<span class="i0">And as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,</span>
<span class="i0">Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or the knocker of iron;<span class="linenum">110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Or, at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village,</span>
<span class="i0">Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered</span>
<span class="i0">Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of the music.</span>
<span class="i0">But among all who came young Gabriel only was welcome;</span>
<span class="i0">Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the blacksmith,<span class="linenum">115</span></span>
<span class="i0">Who was a mighty man in the village, and honoured of all men;</span>
<span class="i0">For since the birth of time, throughout all ages and nations,</span>
<span class="i0">Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people.</span>
<span class="i0">Basil was Benedict&#8217;s friend. Their children from earliest childhood</span>
<span class="i0">Grew up together as brother and sister; and Father Felician,<span class="linenum">120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had taught them their letters</span>
<span class="i0">Out of the selfsame book, with the hymns of the church and the plain-song.</span>
<span class="i0">But when the hymn was sung, and the daily lesson completed,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith.</span>
<span class="i0">There at the door they stood, with wondering eyes to behold him<span class="linenum">125</span></span>
<span class="i0">Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,</span>
<span class="i0">Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel</span>
<span class="i0">Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a circle of cinders.</span>
<span class="i0">Oft on autumnal eves, when without in the gathering darkness</span>
<span class="i0">Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through every cranny and crevice,<span class="linenum">130</span></span>
<span class="i0">Warm by the forge within they watched the labouring bellows,</span>
<span class="i0">And as its panting ceased, and the sparks expired in the ashes,</span>
<span class="i0">Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going into the chapel.</span>
<span class="i0">Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop of the eagle,</span>
<span class="i0">Down the hillside bounding, they glided away o&#8217;er the meadow.<span class="linenum">135</span></span>
<span class="i0">Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,</span>
<span class="i0">Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone, which the swallow</span>
<span class="i0">Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings;</span>
<span class="i0">Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow!</span>
<span class="i0">Thus passed a few swift years, and they no longer were children.<span class="linenum">140</span></span>
<span class="i0">He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the face of the morning,</span>
<span class="i0">Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened thought into action.</span>
<span class="i0">She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes of a woman.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Sunshine of Saint Eulalie&#8221; was she called; for that was the sunshine</span>
<span class="i0">Which, as the farmers believed, would load their orchards with apples;<span class="linenum">145</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
She too would bring to her husband&#8217;s house delight and abundance,</span>
<span class="i0">Filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children.</span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder and longer,</span>
<span class="i0">And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters.</span>
<span class="i0">Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,<span class="linenum">150</span></span>
<span class="i0">Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands.</span>
<span class="i0">Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September</span>
<span class="i0">Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel.</span>
<span class="i0">All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement.</span>
<span class="i0">Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey<span class="linenum">155</span></span>
<span class="i0">Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian hunters asserted</span>
<span class="i0">Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes.</span>
<span class="i0">Such was the advent of autumn. Then followed that beautiful season,</span>
<span class="i0">Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!</span>
<span class="i0">Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape<span class="linenum">160</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.</span>
<span class="i0">Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean</span>
<span class="i0">Was for a moment consoled. All sounds were in harmony blended.</span>
<span class="i0">Voices of children at play, the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards,</span>
<span class="i0">Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons,<span class="linenum">165</span></span>
<span class="i0">All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love, and the great sun</span>
<span class="i0">Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapours around him;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,</span>
<span class="i0">Bright with the sheen of the dew, each glittering tree of the forest</span>
<span class="i0">Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and jewels.<span class="linenum">170</span></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness.</span>
<span class="i0">Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending</span>
<span class="i0">Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead.</span>
<span class="i0">Pawing the ground they came, and resting their necks on each other,</span>
<span class="i0">And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening.<span class="linenum">175</span></span>
<span class="i0">Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline&#8217;s beautiful heifer,</span>
<span class="i0">Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon that waved from her collar,</span>
<span class="i0">Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of human affection.</span>
<span class="i0">Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,</span>
<span class="i0">Where was their favourite pasture. Behind them followed the watch-dog,<span class="linenum">180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct,</span>
<span class="i0">Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly</span>
<span class="i0">Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers;</span>
<span class="i0">Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector,</span>
<span class="i0">When from the forest at night, through the starry silence, the wolves howled.<span class="linenum">185</span></span>
<span class="i0">Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,</span>
<span class="i0">Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odour.</span>
<span class="i0">Cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,</span>
<span class="i0">While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,</span>
<span class="i0">Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,<span class="linenum">190</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms.</span>
<span class="i0">Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the milkmaid&#8217;s hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence</span>
<span class="i0">Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.</span>
<span class="i0">Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,<span class="linenum">195</span></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed back by the barns. Anon they sank into stillness;</span>
<span class="i0">Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,</span>
<span class="i0">Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer</span>
<span class="i0">Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths<span class="linenum">200</span></span>
<span class="i0">Struggled together like foes in a burning city. Behind him,</span>
<span class="i0">Nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic,</span>
<span class="i0">Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness.</span>
<span class="i0">Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair</span>
<span class="i0">Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser<span class="linenum">205</span></span>
<span class="i0">Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine.</span>
<span class="i0">Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him</span>
<span class="i0">Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.</span>
<span class="i0">Close at her father&#8217;s side was the gentle Evangeline seated,<span class="linenum">210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her.</span>
<span class="i0">Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle,</span>
<span class="i0">While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Followed the old man&#8217;s song, and united the fragments together.</span>
<span class="i0">As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,<span class="linenum">215</span></span>
<span class="i0">Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of the priest at the altar,</span>
<span class="i0">So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted,</span>
<span class="i0">Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges.</span>
<span class="i0">Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith,<span class="linenum">220</span></span>
<span class="i0">And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Welcome!&#8221; the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused on the threshold,</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Welcome, Basil, my friend! Come, take thy place on the settle</span>
<span class="i0">Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;</span>
<span class="i0">Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;<span class="linenum">225</span></span>
<span class="i0">Never so much thyself art thou as when, through the curling</span>
<span class="i0">Smoke of the pipe or the forge, thy friendly and jovial face gleams</span>
<span class="i0">Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,</span>
<span class="i0">Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:&mdash;<span class="linenum">230</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!</span>
<span class="i0">Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with</span>
<span class="i0">Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them.</span>
<span class="i0">Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,<span class="linenum">235</span></span>
<span class="i0">And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors</span>
<span class="i0">Bide in the Gaspereau&#8217;s mouth, with their cannon pointed against us.</span>
<span class="i0">What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded</span>
<span class="i0">On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty&#8217;s mandate<span class="linenum">240</span></span>
<span class="i0">Will be proclaimed as law in the land. Alas! in the meantime</span>
<span class="i0">Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then made answer the farmer:&mdash;&#8220;Perhaps some friendlier purpose</span>
<span class="i0">Brings these ships to our shores. Perhaps the harvests in England</span>
<span class="i0">By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,<span class="linenum">245</span></span>
<span class="i0">And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Not so thinketh the folk in the village,&#8221; said warmly the blacksmith,</span>
<span class="i0">Shaking his head as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Séjour, nor Port Royal.</span>
<span class="i0">Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts,<span class="linenum">250</span></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow.</span>
<span class="i0">Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;</span>
<span class="i0">Nothing is left but the blacksmith&#8217;s sledge and the scythe of the mower.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,<span class="linenum">255</span></span>
<span class="i0">Safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy&#8217;s cannon.</span>
<span class="i0">Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow</span>
<span class="i0">Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the night of the contract.</span>
<span class="i0">Built are the house and the barn. The merry lads of the village<span class="linenum">260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,</span>
<span class="i0">Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth.</span>
<span class="i0">René Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and ink-horn.</span>
<span class="i0">Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover&#8217;s,<span class="linenum">265</span></span>
<span class="i0">Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,</span>
<span class="i0">And as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered.</span>
</div></div></div>

<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Bent like a labouring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,</span>
<span class="i0">Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;</span>
<span class="i0">Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung <span class="linenum">270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows</span>
<span class="i0">Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal.</span>
<span class="i0">Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred</span>
<span class="i0">Children&#8217;s children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick.</span>
<span class="i0">Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,<span class="linenum">275</span></span>
<span class="i0">Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.</span>
<span class="i0">Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and child-like.</span>
<span class="i0">He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;</span>
<span class="i0">For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,<span class="linenum">280</span></span>
<span class="i0">And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,</span>
<span class="i0">And of the white Létiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened</span>
<span class="i0">Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;</span>
<span class="i0">And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,</span>
<span class="i0">And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,<span class="linenum">285</span></span>
<span class="i0">And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes,</span>
<span class="i0">With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village.</span>
<span class="i0">Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith,</span>
<span class="i0">Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand,</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Father Leblanc,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;thou hast heard the talk in the village,<span class="linenum">290</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then with modest demeanour made answer the notary public,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser;</span>
<span class="i0">And what their errand may be I know no better than others.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention<span class="linenum">295</span></span>
<span class="i0">Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;God&#8217;s name!&#8221; shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?</span>
<span class="i0">Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">But, without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public,&mdash;<span class="linenum">300</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me,</span>
<span class="i0">When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">This was the old man&#8217;s favourite tale, and he loved to repeat it</span>
<span class="i0">When his neighbours complained that any injustice was done them.<span class="linenum">305</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember,</span>
<span class="i0">Raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of Justice</span>
<span class="i0">Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided</span>
<span class="i0">Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people.<span class="linenum">310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,</span>
<span class="i0">Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them.</span>
<span class="i0">But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;</span>
<span class="i0">Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty</span>
<span class="i0">Ruled with an iron rod. Then it chanced in a nobleman&#8217;s palace<span class="linenum">315</span></span>
<span class="i0">That a necklace of pearls was lost, and ere long a suspicion</span>
<span class="i0">Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household.</span>
<span class="i0">She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,</span>
<span class="i0">Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice.</span>
<span class="i0">As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,<span class="linenum">320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! o&#8217;er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder</span>
<span class="i0">Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand</span>
<span class="i0">Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,</span>
<span class="i0">Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was in-woven.&#8221;<span class="linenum">325</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith</span>
<span class="i0">Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language;</span>
<span class="i0">All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapours</span>
<span class="i0">Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,<span class="linenum">330</span></span>
<span class="i0">Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed</span>
<span class="i0">Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pré;</span>
<span class="i0">While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and ink-horn,</span>
<span class="i0">Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,</span>
<span class="i0">Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle.<span class="linenum">335</span></span>
<span class="i0">Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed,</span>
<span class="i0">And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin.</span>
<span class="i0">Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table</span>
<span class="i0">Three times the old man&#8217;s fee in solid pieces of silver;</span>
<span class="i0">And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and bridegroom,<span class="linenum">340</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare.</span>
<span class="i0">Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed,</span>
<span class="i0">While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,</span>
<span class="i0">Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner.</span>
<span class="i0">Soon was the game begun. In friendly contention the old men<span class="linenum">345</span></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful man&#339;uvre,</span>
<span class="i0">Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row.</span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a window&#8217;s embrasure,</span>
<span class="i0">Sat the lovers and whispered together, beholding the moon rise</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.<span class="linenum">350</span></span>
<span class="i0">Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell from the belfry</span>
<span class="i0">Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway</span>
<span class="i0">Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.<span class="linenum">355</span></span>
<span class="i0">Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step</span>
<span class="i0">Lingered long in Evangeline&#8217;s heart, and filled it with gladness.</span>
<span class="i0">Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,</span>
<span class="i0">And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer.</span>
<span class="i0">Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed.<span class="linenum">360</span></span>
<span class="i0">Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,</span>
<span class="i0">Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden.</span>
<span class="i0">Silent she passed through the hall, and entered the door of her chamber.</span>
<span class="i0">Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press</span>
<span class="i0">Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded<span class="linenum">365</span></span>
<span class="i0">Linen and woollen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven.</span>
<span class="i0">This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,</span>
<span class="i0">Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife.</span>
<span class="i0">Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight</span>
<span class="i0">Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden<span class="linenum">370</span></span>
<span class="i0">Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with</span>
<span class="i0">Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!</span>
<span class="i0">Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,</span>
<span class="i0">Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.<span class="linenum">375</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness</span>
<span class="i0">Passed o&#8217;er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight</span>
<span class="i0">Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.</span>
<span class="i0">And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass</span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,<span class="linenum">380</span></span>
<span class="i0">As out of Abraham&#8217;s tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar.</span>

<span class="i5">Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pré.</span>
<span class="i0">Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas,</span>
<span class="i0">Where the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor.</span>
<span class="i0">Life had long been astir in the village, and clamorous labour<span class="linenum">385</span></span>
<span class="i0">Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning.</span>
<span class="i0">Now from the country around, from the farms and neighbouring hamlets,</span>
<span class="i0">Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants.</span>
<span class="i0">Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk</span>
<span class="i0">Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows,<span class="linenum">390</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,</span>
<span class="i0">Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway.</span>
<span class="i0">Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labour were silenced.</span>
<span class="i0">Thronged were the streets with people; and noisy groups at the house-doors</span>
<span class="i0">Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and gossiped together.<span class="linenum">395</span></span>
<span class="i0">Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted;</span>
<span class="i0">For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together,</span>
<span class="i0">All things were held in common, and what one had was another&#8217;s.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet under Benedict&#8217;s roof hospitality seemed more abundant:</span>
<span class="i0">For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father;<span class="linenum">400</span></span>
<span class="i0">Bright was her face with smiles, and words of welcome and gladness</span>
<span class="i0">Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the cup as she gave it.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Under the open sky, in the odorous air of the orchard,</span>
<span class="i0">Stript of its golden fruit, was spread the feast of betrothal.</span>
<span class="i0">There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated;<span class="linenum">405</span></span>
<span class="i0">There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the blacksmith.</span>
<span class="i0">Not far withdrawn from these, by the cider-press and the beehives,</span>
<span class="i0">Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats.</span>
<span class="i0">Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white</span>
<span class="i0">Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly face of the fiddler<span class="linenum">410</span></span>
<span class="i0">Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers.</span>
<span class="i0">Gaily the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres, and Le Carillon de Dunkerque</i>,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music.</span>
<span class="i0">Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances<span class="linenum">415</span></span>
<span class="i0">Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows;</span>
<span class="i0">Old folk and young together, and children mingled among them.</span>
<span class="i0">Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline, Benedict&#8217;s daughter!</span>
<span class="i0">Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of the blacksmith!</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">So passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous<span class="linenum">420</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat.</span>
<span class="i0">Thronged ere long was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,</span>
<span class="i0">Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones</span>
<span class="i0">Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.</span>
<span class="i0">Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them <span class="linenum">425</span></span>
<span class="i0">Entered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor</span>
<span class="i0">Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal</span>
<span class="i0">Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers.</span>
<span class="i0">Then uprose their commander, and spake from the steps of the altar,<span class="linenum">430</span></span>
<span class="i0">Holding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;You are convened this day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;by his Majesty&#8217;s orders.</span>
<span class="i0">Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness</span>
<span class="i0">Let your own hearts reply! To my natural make and my temper</span>
<span class="i0">Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.<span class="linenum">435</span></span>
<span class="i0">Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch:</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds</span>
<span class="i0">Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province</span>
<span class="i0">Be transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there</span>
<span class="i0">Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!<span class="linenum">440</span></span>
<span class="i0">Prisoners now I declare you, for such is his Majesty&#8217;s pleasure!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">As, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,</span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones</span>
<span class="i0">Beats down the farmer&#8217;s corn in the field, and shatters his windows,</span>
<span class="i0">Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs,<span class="linenum">445</span></span>
<span class="i0">Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their enclosures;</span>
<span class="i0">So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.</span>
<span class="i0">Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose</span>
<span class="i0">Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,</span>
<span class="i0">And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the door-way.<span class="linenum">450</span></span>
<span class="i0">Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations</span>
<span class="i0">Rang through the house of prayer; and high o&#8217;er the heads of the others</span>
<span class="i0">Rose with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,</span>
<span class="i0">As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.</span>
<span class="i0">Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,&mdash;<span class="linenum">455</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!</span>
<span class="i0">Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier</span>
<span class="i0">Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,<span class="linenum">460</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician</span>
<span class="i0">Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar.</span>
<span class="i0">Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence</span>
<span class="i0">All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;</span>
<span class="i0">Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful<span class="linenum"> 465</span></span>
<span class="i0">Spake he, as, after the tocsin&#8217;s alarum, distinctly the clock strikes.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?</span>
<span class="i0">Forty years of my life have I laboured among you, and taught you,</span>
<span class="i0">Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!</span>
<span class="i0">Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?<span class="linenum">470</span></span>
<span class="i0">Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness?</span>
<span class="i0">This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it</span>
<span class="i0">Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?</span>
<span class="i0">Lo! where the crucified Christ from His cross is gazing upon you!</span>
<span class="i0">See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!<span class="linenum">475</span></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, &#8216;O Father, forgive them!&#8217;</span>
<span class="i0">Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,</span>
<span class="i0">Let us repeat it now, and say, &#8216;O Father, forgive them!&#8217;&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people</span>
<span class="i0">Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,<span class="linenum">480</span></span>
<span class="i0">While they repeated his prayer, and said, &#8220;O Father, forgive them!&#8221;</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Then came the evening service. The tapers gleamed from the altar;</span>
<span class="i0">Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest, and the people responded.</span>
<span class="i0">Not with their lips alone, but their hearts; and the Ave Maria</span>
<span class="i0">Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated,<span class="linenum">485</span></span>
<span class="i0">Rose on the ardour of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill, and on all sides</span>
<span class="i0">Wandered, wailing, from house to house the women and children.</span>
<span class="i0">Long at her father&#8217;s door Evangeline stood, with her right hand</span>
<span class="i0">Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that, descending,<span class="linenum">490</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lighted the village street with mysterious splendour, and roofed each</span>
<span class="i0">Peasant&#8217;s cottage with golden thatch, and emblazoned its windows.</span>
<span class="i0">Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table;</span>
<span class="i0">There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey fragrant with wild flowers;</span>
<span class="i0">There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy;<span class="linenum">495</span></span>
<span class="i0">And at the head of the board the great arm-chair of the farmer.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus did Evangeline wait at her father&#8217;s door, as the sunset</span>
<span class="i0">Threw the long shadows of trees o&#8217;er the broad ambrosial meadows.</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen.</span>
<span class="i0">And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,&mdash;<span class="linenum">500</span></span>
<span class="i0">Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and forgiveness and patience!</span>
<span class="i0">Then all forgetful of self she wandered into the village,</span>
<span class="i0">Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
As o&#8217;er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed.</span>
<span class="i0">Urged by their household cares, and the weary feet of their children.<span class="linenum">505</span></span>
<span class="i0">Down sank the great red sun, and in golden, glimmering vapours</span>
<span class="i0">Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet descending from Sinai.</span>
<span class="i0">Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church Evangeline lingered.</span>
<span class="i0">All was silent within; and in vain at the door and the windows<span class="linenum">510</span></span>
<span class="i0">Stood she, and listened and looked, until overcome by emotion,</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gabriel!&#8221; cried she aloud with tremulous voice; but no answer</span>
<span class="i0">Came from the graves of the dead, nor the gloomier grave of the living.</span>
<span class="i0">Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father.</span>
<span class="i0">Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board was the supper untasted.<span class="linenum"> 515</span></span>
<span class="i0">Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with phantoms of terror.</span>
<span class="i0">Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber.</span>
<span class="i0">In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall</span>
<span class="i0">Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window.</span>
<span class="i0">Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of the echoing thunder<span class="linenum">520</span></span>
<span class="i0">Told her that God was in heaven, and governed the world He created!</span>
<span class="i0">Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven;</span>
<span class="i0">Soothed was her troubled soul, and she peacefully slumbered till morning.</span>

<span class="i5">Four times the sun had risen and set, and now on the fifth day</span>
<span class="i0">Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse.<span class="linenum">525</span></span>
<span class="i0">Soon o&#8217;er the yellow fields, in silent mournful procession,</span>
<span class="i0">Came from the neighbouring hamlets and farms the Acadian women,</span>
<span class="i0">Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea-shore,</span>
<span class="i0">Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,</span>
<span class="i0">Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland.<span class="linenum">530</span></span>
<span class="i0">Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen,</span>
<span class="i0">While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Thus to the Gaspereau&#8217;s mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach</span>

<span class="i0">All day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply;<span class="linenum">535</span></span>
<span class="i0">All day long the wains came labouring down from the village.</span>
<span class="i0">Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to his setting,</span>
<span class="i0">Echoed far o&#8217;er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard.</span>
<span class="i0">Thither the women and children thronged. On a sudden the church-doors</span>
<span class="i0">Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching in gloomy procession<span class="linenum">540</span></span>
<span class="i0">Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian farmers.</span>
<span class="i0">Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their homes and their country,</span>
<span class="i0">Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,</span>
<span class="i0">So with songs on their lips the Acadian peasants descended</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Down from the church to the shore, amid their wives and their daughters.<span class="linenum">545</span></span>
<span class="i0">Foremost the young men came; and, raising together their voices,</span>
<span class="i0">Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Sacred heart of the Saviour! O inexhaustible fountain!</span>
<span class="i0">Fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the wayside<span class="linenum">550</span></span>
<span class="i0">Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them</span>
<span class="i0">Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited in silence,</span>
<span class="i0">Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour of affliction,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Calmly and sadly she waited, until the procession approached her,<span class="linenum">555</span></span>
<span class="i0">And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion.</span>
<span class="i0">Tears then filled her eyes, and eagerly running to meet him,</span>
<span class="i0">Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his shoulder, and whispered,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one another</span>
<span class="i0">Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances may happen!&#8221;<span class="linenum">560</span></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly paused, for her father</span>
<span class="i0">Saw she, slowly advancing. Alas! how changed was his aspect!</span>
<span class="i0">Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire from his eye, and his footstep</span>
<span class="i0">Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom.</span>
<span class="i0">But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his neck and embraced him,<span class="linenum">565</span></span>
<span class="i0">Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus to the Gaspereau&#8217;s mouth moved on that mournful procession.</span>

There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking.</span>
<span class="i0">Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion</span>
<span class="i0">Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children<span class="linenum">570</span></span>
<span class="i0">Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties.</span>
<span class="i0">So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried,</span>
<span class="i0">While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father.</span>
<span class="i0">Half the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight</span>
<span class="i0">Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean<span class="linenum">575</span></span>
<span class="i0">Fled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach</span>
<span class="i0">Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed.</span>
<span class="i0">Further back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,</span>
<span class="i0">Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a battle,</span>
<span class="i0">All escape cut off by the sea, and the sentinels near them,<span class="linenum">580</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers.</span>
<span class="i0">Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,</span>
<span class="i0">Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles, and leaving</span>
<span class="i0">Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, as the night descended, the herds returned from their pastures;<span class="linenum">585</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet was the moist still air with the odour of milk from their udders:</span>
<span class="i0">Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known bars of the farm-yard,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid.</span>
<span class="i0">Silence reigned in the streets; from the church no Angelus sounded,</span>

But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,</span>
<span class="i0">Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest.</span>
<span class="i0">Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,</span>
<span class="i0">Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the crying of children.</span>
<span class="i0">Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to hearth in his parish,<span class="linenum">595</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and blessing and cheering,</span>
<span class="i0">Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita&#8217;s desolate sea-shore.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father,</span>
<span class="i0">And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,</span>
<span class="i0">Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either thought or emotion,<span class="linenum">600</span></span>
<span class="i0">E&#8217;en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken.</span>
<span class="i0">Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,</span>
<span class="i0">Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he looked not, he spake not,</span>
<span class="i0">But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the flickering fire-light.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;<i>Benedicite!</i>&#8221; murmured the priest, in tones of compassion.<span class="linenum">605</span></span>
<span class="i0">More he fain would have said, but his heart was full, and his accents</span>
<span class="i0">Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of a child on a threshold,</span>
<span class="i0">Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow.</span>
<span class="i0">Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,</span>
<span class="i0">Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them<span class="linenum">610</span></span>
<span class="i0">Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals.</span>
<span class="i0">Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence.</span>

Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in autumn the blood-red</span>
<span class="i0">Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o&#8217;er the horizon</span>
<span class="i0">Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,<span class="linenum">615</span></span>
<span class="i0">Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together.</span>
<span class="i0">Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,</span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead.</span>
<span class="i0">Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were</span>
<span class="i0">Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.<span class="linenum">620</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,</span>
<span class="i0">Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred house-tops</span>
<span class="i0">Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.</span>
<span class="i0">Speechless at first they stood, then cried aloud in their anguish,<span class="linenum">625</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pré!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards,</span>
<span class="i0">Thinking the day had dawned; and anon the lowing of cattle</span>
<span class="i0">Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of dogs interrupted.</span>
<span class="i0">Then rose a sound of dread, such as startles the sleeping encampments<span class="linenum">630</span></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the western prairies of forests that skirt the Nebraska,</span>
<span class="i0">When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,</span>
<span class="i0">Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Such was the sound that arose on the night, as the herds and the horses</span>
<span class="i0">Broke through their folds and fences, and madly rushed o&#8217;er the meadows.<span class="linenum">635</span></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maiden</span>
<span class="i0">Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them;</span>
<span class="i0">And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,</span>
<span class="i0">Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched abroad on the sea-shore</span>
<span class="i0">Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed.<span class="linenum">640</span></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head, and the maiden</span>
<span class="i0">Knelt at her father&#8217;s side, and wailed aloud in her terror.</span>
<span class="i0">Then in a swoon she sank, and lay with her head on his bosom.</span>
<span class="i0">Through the long night she lay in deep, oblivious slumber;</span>
<span class="i0">And when she woke from the trance, she beheld a multitude near her.<span class="linenum">645</span></span>
<span class="i0">Faces of friends she beheld, that were mournfully gazing upon her,</span>
<span class="i0">Pallid, with tearful eyes, and looks of saddest compassion.</span>
<span class="i0">Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,</span>
<span class="i0">Reddened the sky overhead, and gleamed on the faces around her,</span>
<span class="i0">And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses.<span class="linenum">650</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to the people,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Let us bury him here by the sea. When a happier season</span>
<span class="i0">Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,</span>
<span class="i0">Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Such were the words of the priest. And there in haste by the sea-side,<span class="linenum">655</span></span>
<span class="i0">Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,</span>
<span class="i0">But without bell or book, they buried the farmer of Grand-Pré.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,</span>
<span class="i0">Lo! with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation,</span>
<span class="i0">Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges.<span class="linenum">660</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Twas the returning tide, that afar from the waste of the ocean,</span>
<span class="i0">With the first dawn of the day, came heaving and hurrying landward.</span>
<span class="i0">Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking;</span>
<span class="i0">And with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbour,</span>
<span class="i0">Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and the village in ruins.<span class="linenum">665</span></span>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pré,</span>
<span class="i0">When on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,</span>
<span class="i0">Bearing a nation, with all its household goods, into exile,</span>
<span class="i0">Exile without an end, and without an example in story.</span>
<span class="i0">Far asunder, on separate coasts, the Acadians landed;<span class="linenum">670</span></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered were they, like flakes of snow, when the wind from the northeast</span>
<span class="i0">Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland.</span>
<span class="i0">Friendless, homeless, hopeless, they wandered from city to city,</span>
<span class="i0">From the cold lakes of the North to sultry Southern savannas,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the Father of Waters<span class="linenum">675</span></span>
<span class="i0">Seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them down to the ocean,</span>
<span class="i0">Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Friends they sought and homes; and many, despairing, heart-broken,</span>
<span class="i0">Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a friend nor a fireside.</span>
<span class="i0">Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards.<span class="linenum">680</span></span>
<span class="i0">Long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,</span>
<span class="i0">Lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things.</span>
<span class="i0">Fair was she and young; but, alas! before her extended,</span>
<span class="i0">Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life, with its pathway</span>
<span class="i0">Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,<span class="linenum">685</span></span>
<span class="i0">Passions long extinguished, and hopes long dead and abandoned,</span>
<span class="i0">As the emigrant&#8217;s way o&#8217;er the Western desert is marked by</span>
<span class="i0">Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach in the sunshine.</span>
<span class="i0">Something there was in her life incomplete, imperfect, unfinished;</span>
<span class="i0">As if a morning of June, with all its music and sunshine,<span class="linenum">690</span></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly paused in the sky, and, fading, slowly descended</span>
<span class="i0">Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen.</span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes she lingered in towns, till, urged by the fever within her,</span>
<span class="i0">Urged by a restless longing, the hunger and thirst of the spirit,</span>
<span class="i0">She would commence again her endless search and endeavour;<span class="linenum">695</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes in churchyards strayed, and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,</span>
<span class="i0">Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that perhaps in its bosom</span>
<span class="i0">He was already at rest, and she longed to slumber beside him.</span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes a rumour, a hearsay, an inarticulate whisper,</span>
<span class="i0">Came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward.<span class="linenum">700</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
But it was long ago, in some far-off place or forgotten.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gabriel Lajeunesse!&#8221; they said; &#8220;Oh, yes! we have seen him.</span>
<span class="i0">He was with Basil the blacksmith, and both have gone to the prairies;</span>
<span class="i0">Coureurs-des-bois are they, and famous hunters and trappers.&#8221;<span class="linenum">705</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gabriel Lajeunesse!&#8221; said others; &#8220;Oh, yes! we have seen him.</span>
<span class="i0">He is a voyageur in the lowlands of Louisiana.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then would they say, &#8220;Dear child! why dream and wait for him longer?</span>
<span class="i0">Are there not other youths as fair as Gabriel? others</span>
<span class="i0">Who have hearts as tender and true, and spirits as loyal?<span class="linenum">710</span></span>
<span class="i0">Here is Baptiste Leblanc, the notary&#8217;s son, who has loved thee</span>
<span class="i0">Many a tedious year; come, give him thy hand and be happy!</span>
<span class="i0">Thou art too fair to be left to braid St. Catherine&#8217;s tresses.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then would Evangeline answer, serenely but sadly, &#8220;I cannot!</span>
<span class="i0">Whither my heart has gone, there follows my hand, and not elsewhere.<span class="linenum">715</span></span>
<span class="i0">For when the heart goes before, like a lamp, and illumines the pathway,</span>
<span class="i0">Many things are made clear, that else lie hidden in darkness.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Thereupon the priest, her friend and father confessor,</span>
<span class="i0">Said, with a smile, &#8220;O daughter! thy God thus speaketh within thee!</span>
<span class="i0">Talk not of wasted affection, affection never was wasted;<span class="linenum">720</span></span>
<span class="i0">If it enrich not the heart of another, its waters, returning</span>
<span class="i0">Back to their springs, like the rain, shall fill them full of refreshment;</span>
<span class="i0">That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain.</span>
<span class="i0">Patience; accomplish thy labour; accomplish thy work of affection!</span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike.<span class="linenum">725</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Therefore accomplish thy labour of love, till the heart is made godlike,</span>
<span class="i0">Purified, strengthened, perfected, and rendered more worthy of heaven!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Cheered by the good man&#8217;s words, Evangeline laboured and waited.</span>
<span class="i0">Still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,</span>
<span class="i0">But with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered, &#8220;Despair not!&#8221;<span class="linenum">730</span></span>
<span class="i0">Thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort,</span>
<span class="i0">Bleeding, barefooted, over the shards and thorns of existence.</span>
<span class="i0">Let me essay, O Muse! to follow the wanderer&#8217;s footsteps;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Not through each devious path, each changeful year of existence;</span>
<span class="i0">But as a traveller follows a streamlet&#8217;s course through the valley:<span class="linenum">735</span></span>
<span class="i0">Far from its margin at times, and seeing the gleam of its water</span>
<span class="i0">Here and there, in some open space, and at intervals only;</span>
<span class="i0">Then drawing nearer its banks, through sylvan glooms that conceal it,</span>
<span class="i0">Though he behold it not, he can hear its continuous murmur;</span>
<span class="i0">Happy, at length, if he find a spot where it reaches an outlet.<span class="linenum">740</span></span>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">It was the month of May. Far down the Beautiful River,</span>
<span class="i0">Past the Ohio shore and past the mouth of the Wabash,</span>
<span class="i0">Into the golden stream of the broad and swift Mississippi,</span>
<span class="i0">Floated a cumbrous boat, that was rowed by Acadian boatmen,</span>
<span class="i0">It was a band of exiles; a raft, as it were, from the shipwrecked<span class="linenum">745</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nation, scattered along the coast, now floating together,</span>
<span class="i0">Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Men and women and children, who, guided by hope or by hearsay,</span>
<span class="i0">Sought for their kith and their kin among the few-acred farmers</span>
<span class="i0">On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair Opelousas.<span class="linenum">750</span></span>
<span class="i0">With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the Father Felician.</span>
<span class="i0">Onward o&#8217;er sunken sands, through a wilderness sombre with forests,</span>
<span class="i0">Day after day they glided adown the turbulent river;</span>
<span class="i0">Night after night, by their blazing fires, encamped on its borders.</span>
<span class="i0">Now through rushing chutes, among green islands, where plumelike<span class="linenum">755</span></span>
<span class="i0">Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests, they swept with the current,</span>
<span class="i0">Then emerged into broad lagoons, where silvery sand-bars</span>
<span class="i0">Lay in the stream, and along the wimpling waves of their margin,</span>
<span class="i0">Shining with snow-white plumes, large flocks of pelicans waded.</span>
<span class="i0">Level the landscape grew, and along the shores of the river,<span class="linenum">760</span></span>
<span class="i0">Shaded by china-trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens,</span>
<span class="i0">Stood the houses of planters, with negro cabins and dove-cots.</span>
<span class="i0">They were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,</span>
<span class="i0">Where through the Golden Coast, and groves of orange and citron,</span>
<span class="i0">Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward.<span class="linenum">765</span></span>
<span class="i0">They, too, swerved from their course; and, entering the Bayou of Plaquemine,</span>
<span class="i0">Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,</span>
<span class="i0">Which, like a network of steel, extended in every direction.</span>
<span class="i0">Over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress</span>
<span class="i0">Met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in mid-air<span class="linenum">770</span></span>
<span class="i0">Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Deathlike the silence seemed, and unbroken, save by the herons</span>
<span class="i0">Home to their roosts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,</span>
<span class="i0">Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter.</span>
<span class="i0">Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,<span class="linenum">775</span></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,</span>
<span class="i0">Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.</span>
<span class="i0">Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all things around them;</span>
<span class="i0">And o&#8217;er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Strange forebodings of ill, unseen and that cannot be compassed.<span class="linenum">780</span></span>
<span class="i0">As, at the tramp of a horse&#8217;s hoof on the turf of the prairies,</span>
<span class="i0">Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,</span>
<span class="i0">So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil,</span>
<span class="i0">Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.</span>
<span class="i0">But Evangeline&#8217;s heart was sustained by a vision, that faintly<span class="linenum">785</span></span>
<span class="i0">Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight.</span>
<span class="i0">It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.</span>
<span class="i0">Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her,</span>
<span class="i0">And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Then in his place, at the prow of the boat, rose one of the oarsmen,<span class="linenum">790</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, as a signal sound, if others like them peradventure</span>
<span class="i0">Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams, blew a blast on his bugle.</span>
<span class="i0">Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest.</span>
<span class="i0">Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music.<span class="linenum">795</span></span>
<span class="i0">Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,</span>
<span class="i0">Over the watery floor, and beneath the reverberant branches;</span>
<span class="i0">But not a voice replied; no answer came from the darkness;</span>
<span class="i0">And when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of pain was the silence.</span>
<span class="i0">Then Evangeline slept; but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,<span class="linenum">800</span></span>
<span class="i0">Silent at times, then singing familiar Canadian boat-songs,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian rivers,</span>
<span class="i0">While through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,</span>
<span class="i0">Far off,&mdash;indistinct,&mdash;as of wave or wind in the forest,</span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator.<span class="linenum">805</span></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades; and before them</span>
<span class="i0">Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the Atchafalaya.</span>
<span class="i0">Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations</span>
<span class="i0">Made by the passing oars, and, resplendent in beauty, the lotus</span>
<span class="i0">Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen.<span class="linenum">810</span></span>
<span class="i0">Faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,</span>
<span class="i0">And with the heat of noon; and numberless sylvan islands,</span>
<span class="i0">Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,</span>
<span class="i0">Near to whose shores they glided along, invited to slumber.</span>
<span class="i0">Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended.<span class="linenum">815</span></span>
<span class="i0">Under the boughs of Wachita willows, that grew by the margin,</span>
<span class="i0">Safely their boat was moored; and scattered about on the greensward,</span>
<span class="i0">Tired with their midnight toil, the weary travellers slumbered.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar.</span>
<span class="i0">Swinging from its great arms, the trumpet-flower and the grapevine<span class="linenum">820</span></span>
<span class="i0">Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of Jacob,</span>
<span class="i0">On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending, descending,</span>
<span class="i0">Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from blossom to blossom.</span>
<span class="i0">Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it.</span>
<span class="i0">Filled was her heart with love, and the dawn of an opening heaven<span class="linenum">825</span></span>
<span class="i0">Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Nearer, ever nearer, among the numberless islands</span>
<span class="i0">Darted a light, swift boat, that sped away o&#8217;er the water</span>
<span class="i0">Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers.</span>
<span class="i0">Northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver.<span class="linenum">830</span></span>
<span class="i0">At the helm sat a youth, with countenance thoughtful and careworn.</span>
<span class="i0">Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow, and a sadness</span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written.</span>
<span class="i0">Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting, unhappy and restless,</span>
<span class="i0">Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.<span class="linenum">835</span></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly they glided along, close under the lee of the island,</span>
<span class="i0">But by the opposite bank, and behind a screen of palmettos;</span>
<span class="i0">So that they saw not the boat, where it lay concealed in the willows;</span>
<span class="i0">All undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and unseen were the sleepers;</span>
<span class="i0">Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden.<span class="linenum">840</span></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a cloud on the prairie.</span>
<span class="i0">After the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance.</span>
<span class="i0">As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke, and the maiden</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Said with a sigh to the friendly priest, &#8220;O Father Felician!</span>
<span class="i0">Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders.<span class="linenum">845</span></span>
<span class="i0">Is it a foolish dream, an idle and vague superstition?</span>
<span class="i0">Or has an angel passed, and revealed the truth to my spirit?&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, with a blush, she added, &#8220;Alas for my credulous fancy!</span>
<span class="i0">Unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">But made answer the reverend man, and he smiled as he answered,&mdash;<span class="linenum">850</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they to me without meaning,</span>
<span class="i0">Feeling is deep and still; and the word that floats on the surface</span>
<span class="i0">Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden.</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions.</span>
<span class="i0">Gabriel truly is near thee; for not far away to the south-ward,<span class="linenum">855</span></span>
<span class="i0">On the banks of the Têche, are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin.</span>
<span class="i0">There the long-wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,</span>
<span class="i0">There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheep-fold.</span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful is the land, with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees;</span>
<span class="i0">Under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens<span class="linenum">860</span></span>
<span class="i0">Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest.</span>
<span class="i0">They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana.&#8221;</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey.</span>
<span class="i0">Softly the evening came. The sun from the western horizon</span>
<span class="i0">Like a magician extended his golden wand o&#8217;er the landscape;<span class="linenum">865</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and forest</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together.</span>
<span class="i0">Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges of silver,</span>
<span class="i0">Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water.</span>
<span class="i0">Filled was Evangeline&#8217;s heart with inexpressible sweetness.<span class="linenum">870</span></span>
<span class="i0">Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountains of feeling</span>
<span class="i0">Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her.</span>
<span class="i0">Then from a neighbouring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers,</span>
<span class="i0">Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o&#8217;er the water,</span>
<span class="i0">Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,<span class="linenum">875</span></span>
<span class="i0">That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.</span>
<span class="i0">Plaintive at first were the tones and sad; then soaring to madness</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.</span>
<span class="i0">Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low lamentation;</span>
<span class="i0">Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision,<span class="linenum">880</span></span>
<span class="i0">As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops</span>
<span class="i0">Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.</span>
<span class="i0">With such a prelude as this, and hearts that throbbed with emotion,</span>
<span class="i0">Slowly they entered the Têche, where it flows through the green Opelousas,</span>
<span class="i0">And, through the amber air, above the crest of the woodland,<span class="linenum">885</span></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighbouring dwelling;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle.</span>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Near to the bank of the river, o&#8217;ershadowed by oaks from whose branches</span>
<span class="i0">Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,</span>
<span class="i0">Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yule-tide,<span class="linenum">890</span></span>
<span class="i0">Stood, secluded and still, the house of the herdsman. A garden</span>
<span class="i0">Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,</span>
<span class="i0">Filling the air with fragrance. The house itself was of timbers</span>
<span class="i0">Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together.</span>
<span class="i0">Large and low was the roof; and on slender columns supported,<span class="linenum">895</span></span>
<span class="i0">Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and spacious veranda,</span>
<span class="i0">Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it.</span>
<span class="i0">At each end of the house, amid the flowers of the garden,</span>
<span class="i0">Stationed the dove-cots were, as love&#8217;s perpetual symbol,</span>
<span class="i0">Scenes of endless wooing, and endless contentions of rivals.<span class="linenum">900</span></span>
<span class="i0">Silence reigned o&#8217;er the place. The line of shadow and sunshine</span>
<span class="i0">Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow,</span>
<span class="i0">And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding</span>
<span class="i0">Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose.</span>
<span class="i0">In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway<span class="linenum">905</span></span>
<span class="i0">Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,</span>
<span class="i0">Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.</span>
<span class="i0">Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas</span>
<span class="i0">Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,</span>
<span class="i0">Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grape-vines.<span class="linenum">910</span></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups</span>
<span class="i0">Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin.</span>
<span class="i0">Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero</span>
<span class="i0">Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master.<span class="linenum">915</span></span>
<span class="i0">Round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing</span>
<span class="i0">Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapoury freshness</span>
<span class="i0">That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape.</span>
<span class="i0">Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding</span>
<span class="i0">Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded<span class="linenum">920</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening.</span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle</span>
<span class="i0">Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.</span>
<span class="i0">Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o&#8217;er the prairie,</span>
<span class="i0">And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance.<span class="linenum">925</span></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden</span>
<span class="i0">Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.</span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward</span>
<span class="i0">Pushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder;</span>
<span class="i0">When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith.<span class="linenum">930</span></span>
<span class="i0">Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden.</span>
<span class="i0">There in an arbour of roses with endless question and answer</span>
<span class="i0">Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces,</span>
<span class="i0">Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful.</span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings<span class="linenum">935</span></span>
<span class="i0">Stole o&#8217;er the maiden&#8217;s heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Broke the silence and said, &#8220;If you came by the Atchafalaya,</span>
<span class="i0">How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel&#8217;s boat on the bayous?&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Over Evangeline&#8217;s face at the words of Basil a shade passed.</span>
<span class="i0">Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent, <span class="linenum">940</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gone? is Gabriel gone?&#8221; and, concealing her face on his shoulder,</span>
<span class="i0">All her o&#8217;erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented.</span>
<span class="i0">Then the good Basil said,&mdash;and his voice grew blithe as he said it,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day he departed.</span>
<span class="i0">Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.<span class="linenum">945</span></span>
<span class="i0">Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit</span>
<span class="i0">Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.</span>
<span class="i0">Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,</span>
<span class="i0">Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,</span>
<span class="i0">He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,<span class="linenum">950</span></span>
<span class="i0">Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.</span>
<span class="i0">Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,</span>
<span class="i0">Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver.</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;<span class="linenum">955</span></span>
<span class="i0">He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him.</span>
<span class="i0">Up and away to-morrow, and through the red dew of the morning,</span>
<span class="i0">We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison.&#8221;</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river,</span>
<span class="i0">Borne aloft on his comrades&#8217; arms, came Michael the fiddler.<span class="linenum">960</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Long under Basil&#8217;s roof had he lived, like a god on Olympus,</span>
<span class="i0">Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals.</span>
<span class="i0">Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Long live Michael,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;our brave Acadian minstrel!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway<span class="linenum">965</span></span>
<span class="i0">Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man</span>
<span class="i0">Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured,</span>
<span class="i0">Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips.</span>
<span class="i0">Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters.</span>
<span class="i0">Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci-devant blacksmith,<span class="linenum">970</span></span>
<span class="i0">All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchial demeanour;</span>
<span class="i0">Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,</span>
<span class="i0">And of the prairies, whose numberless herds were his who would take them;</span>
<span class="i0">Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus they ascended the steps, and crossing the breezy veranda,<span class="linenum">975</span></span>
<span class="i0">Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil</span>
<span class="i0">Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended.</span>
<span class="i0">All was silent without, and illuming the landscape with silver,</span>
<span class="i0">Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,<span class="linenum">980</span></span>
<span class="i0">Brighter than these, shone the faces of friend in the glimmering lamplight.</span>
<span class="i0">Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman</span>
<span class="i0">Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco,</span>
<span class="i0">Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened:&mdash;<span class="linenum">985</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,</span>
<span class="i0">Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one!</span>
<span class="i0">Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;</span>
<span class="i0">Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer;</span>
<span class="i0">Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water.<span class="linenum">990</span></span>
<span class="i0">All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom; and grass grows</span>
<span class="i0">More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer.</span>
<span class="i0">Here, too, numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies;</span>
<span class="i0">Here, too, lands may be had for the asking, and forests of timber</span>
<span class="i0">With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses.<span class="linenum">995</span></span>
<span class="i0">After your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests,</span>
<span class="i0">No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads,</span>
<span class="i0">Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing your farms and your cattle.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,</span>
<span class="i0">While his huge, brown hand came thundering down on the table,<span class="linenum">1000</span></span>
<span class="i0">So that the guests all started; and Father Felician, astounded,</span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils.</span>
<span class="i0">But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were milder and gayer:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware of the fever!</span>
<span class="i0">For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate,<span class="linenum">1005</span></span>
<span class="i0">Cured by wearing a spider hung round one&#8217;s neck in a nutshell!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Then there were voices heard at the door, and footsteps approaching</span>
<span class="i0">Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.</span>
<span class="i0">It was the neighbouring Creoles and small Acadian planters,</span>
<span class="i0">Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the herdsman.<span class="linenum">1010</span></span>
<span class="i0">Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbours:</span>
<span class="i0">Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who before were as strangers,</span>
<span class="i0">Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends to each other,</span>
<span class="i0">Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.</span>
<span class="i0">But in the neighbouring hall a strain of music, proceeding<span class="linenum">1015</span></span>
<span class="i0">From the accordant strings of Michael&#8217;s melodious fiddle,</span>
<span class="i0">Broke up all further speech. Away, like children delighted,</span>
<span class="i0">All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening</span>
<span class="i0">Whirl of the dizzy dance, as it swept and swayed to the music,</span>
<span class="i0">Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments.<span class="linenum">1020</span></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman</span>
<span class="i0">Sat, conversing together of past and present and future;</span>
<span class="i0">While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her</span>
<span class="i0">Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music</span>
<span class="i0">Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness<span class="linenum">1025</span></span>
<span class="i0">Came o&#8217;er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden.</span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful was the night. Behind the black wall of the forest,</span>
<span class="i0">Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon. On the river</span>
<span class="i0">Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,</span>
<span class="i0">Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.<span class="linenum">1030</span></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Poured out their souls in odours, that were their prayers and confessions</span>
<span class="i0">Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian.</span>
<span class="i0">Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews,</span>
<span class="i0">Hung the heart of the maiden. The calm and the magical<span class="linenum">1035</span></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings,</span>
<span class="i0">As, through the garden gate, and beneath the shade of the oak-trees,</span>
<span class="i0">Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.</span>
<span class="i0">Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fire-flies</span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers.<span class="linenum">1040</span></span>
<span class="i0">Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,</span>
<span class="i0">Shone on the eyes of man, who had ceased to marvel and worship,</span>
<span class="i0">Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,</span>
<span class="i0">As if a hand had appeared and written upon them, &#8220;Upharsin.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">And the soul of the maiden, between the stars and the fire-flies,<span class="linenum">1045</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wandered alone, and she cried, &#8220;O Gabriel! O my beloved!</span>
<span class="i0">Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot behold thee?</span>
<span class="i0">Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice does not reach me?</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie!</span>
<span class="i0">Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me!<span class="linenum">1050</span></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from labour,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast lain down to rest, and to dream of me in thy slumbers!</span>
<span class="i0">When shall these eyes behold, these arms be folded about thee?&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded</span>
<span class="i0">Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through the neighbouring thickets,<span class="linenum">1055</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Patience!&#8221; whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness;</span>
<span class="i0">And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded, &#8220;To-morrow!&#8221;</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Bright rose the sun next day; and all the flowers of the garden</span>
<span class="i0">Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and anointed his tresses<span class="linenum">1060</span></span>
<span class="i0">With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Farewell!&#8221; said the priest, as he stood at the shadowy threshold;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine,</span>
<span class="i0">And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when the bridegroom was coming.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Farewell!&#8221; answered the maiden, and, smiling, with Basil descended<span class="linenum">1065</span></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the river&#8217;s brink, where the boatmen already were waiting.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus beginning their journey with morning, and sunshine, and gladness,</span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,</span>
<span class="i0">Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.</span>
<span class="i0">Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day that succeeded,<span class="linenum">1070</span></span>
<span class="i0">Found they trace of his course, in lake or forest or river,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor, after many days, had they found him; but vague and uncertain</span>
<span class="i0">Rumours alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country;</span>
<span class="i0">Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes,</span>
<span class="i0">Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from the garrulous landlord<span class="linenum">1075</span></span>
<span class="i0">That on the day before, with horses and guides and companions,</span>
<span class="i0">Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies.</span>

<span class="i0">Day after day, with their Indian guides, the maiden and Basil</span>
<span class="i0">Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o&#8217;ertake him.</span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the smoke of his camp-fire<span class="linenum">1110</span></span>
<span class="i0">Rise in the morning air from the distant plain; but at nightfall,</span>
<span class="i0">When they had reached the place, they found only embers and ashes.</span>
<span class="i0">And, though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,</span>
<span class="i0">Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata Morgana</span>
<span class="i0">Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them.<span class="linenum">1115</span></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Once, as they sat by their evening fire, there silently entered</span>
<span class="i0">Into the little camp an Indian woman, whose features</span>
<span class="i0">Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow.</span>
<span class="i0">She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people,</span>
<span class="i0">From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches,<span class="linenum">1120</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where her Canadian husband, a coureur-des-bois, had been murdered.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Touched were their hearts at her story, and warmest and friendliest welcome</span>
<span class="i0">Gave they, with words of cheer, and she sat and feasted among them</span>
<span class="i0">On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers.</span>
<span class="i0">But when their meal was done, and Basil and all his companions,<span class="linenum">1125</span></span>
<span class="i0">Worn with the long day&#8217;s march and the chase of the deer and the bison,</span>
<span class="i0">Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering fire-light</span>
<span class="i0">Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in the blankets,</span>
<span class="i0">Then at the door of Evangeline&#8217;s tent she sat and repeated</span>
<span class="i0">Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of her Indian accent,<span class="linenum">1130</span></span>
<span class="i0">All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses.</span>
<span class="i0">Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know that another</span>
<span class="i0">Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.</span>
<span class="i0">Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman&#8217;s compassion,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,<span class="linenum">1135</span></span>
<span class="i0">She in turn related her love and all its disasters.</span>
<span class="i0">Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she had ended</span>
<span class="i0">Still was mute; but at length, as if a mysterious horror</span>
<span class="i0">Passed through her brain, she spake, and repeated the tale of the Mowis;</span>
<span class="i0">Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and wedded a maiden,<span class="linenum">1140</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, when the morning came, arose and passed from the wigwam,</span>
<span class="i0">Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,</span>
<span class="i0">Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed like a weird incantation,</span>
<span class="i0">Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was wooed by a phantom,<span class="linenum">1145</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
That through the pines o&#8217;er her father&#8217;s lodge in the hush of the twilight,</span>
<span class="i0">Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered love to the maiden,</span>
<span class="i0">Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,</span>
<span class="i0">And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by her people.</span>
<span class="i0">Silent with wonder and strange surprise, Evangeline listened<span class="linenum">1150</span></span>
<span class="i0">To the soft flow of her magical words, till the region around her</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress.</span>
<span class="i0">Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose,</span>
<span class="i0">Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious splendour</span>
<span class="i0">Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland.<span class="linenum">1155</span></span>
<span class="i0">With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and the branches</span>
<span class="i0">Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers.</span>
<span class="i0">Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline&#8217;s heart, but a secret,</span>
<span class="i0">Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,</span>
<span class="i0">As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow.<span class="linenum">1160</span></span>
<span class="i0">It was no earthly fear. A breath from the region of spirits</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to float in the air of night; and she felt for a moment</span>
<span class="i0">That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom.</span>
<span class="i0">With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Early upon the morrow the march was resumed, and the Shawnee<span class="linenum">1165</span></span>
<span class="i0">Said, as they journeyed along,&mdash;&#8220;On the western slope of these mountains</span>
<span class="i0">Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission.</span>
<span class="i0">Much he teaches the people, and tells them of Mary and Jesus;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with pain, as they hear him.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then, with a sudden and secret emotion, Evangeline answered,<span class="linenum">1170</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Let us go to the Mission, for there good tidings await us!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a spur of the mountains,</span>
<span class="i0">Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur of voices,</span>
<span class="i0">And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of a river,</span>
<span class="i0">Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission.<span class="linenum">1175</span></span>
<span class="i0">Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst of the village,</span>
<span class="i0">Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children. A crucifix fastened</span>
<span class="i0">High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed by grape-vines,</span>
<span class="i0">Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it.</span>
<span class="i0">This was their rural chapel. Aloft, through the intricate arches<span class="linenum">1180</span></span>
<span class="i0">Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their vespers,</span>
<span class="i0">Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches.</span>
<span class="i0">Silent, with heads uncovered, the travellers, nearer approaching,</span>
<span class="i0">Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions.</span>
<span class="i0">But when the service was done, and the benediction had fallen <span class="linenum">1185</span></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the hands of the priest, like seed from the hands of the sower,</span>
<span class="i0">Slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers, and bade them</span>
<span class="i0">Welcome; and when they replied, he smiled with benignant expression,</span>
<span class="i0">Hearing the homelike sounds of his mother-tongue in the forest,</span>
<span class="i0">And, with words of kindness, conducted them into his wigwam.<span class="linenum">1190</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher.</span>
<span class="i0">Soon was their story told; and the priest with solemnity answered:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel, seated</span>
<span class="i0">On this mat by my side, where now the maiden reposes,<span class="linenum">1195</span></span>
<span class="i0">Told me the same sad tale; then arose and continued his journey!&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Soft was the voice of the priest, and he spake with an accent of kindness;</span>
<span class="i0">But on Evangeline&#8217;s heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes</span>
<span class="i0">Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed.</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Far to the north he has gone,&#8221; continued the priest; &#8220;but in autumn,<span class="linenum">1200</span></span>
<span class="i0">When the chase is done, will return again to the Mission.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Then Evangeline said, and her voice was meek and submissive,</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Let me remain with thee, for my soul is sad and afflicted.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">So seemed it wise and well unto all; and betimes on the morrow,</span>
<span class="i0">Mounting his Mexican steed, with his Indian guides and companions,<span class="linenum">1205</span></span>
<span class="i0">Homeward Basil returned, and Evangeline stayed at the Mission.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Slowly, slowly, slowly the days succeeded each other,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Days and weeks and months; and the fields of maize that were springing</span>
<span class="i0">Green from the ground when a stranger she came, now waving about her,</span>
<span class="i0">Lifted their slender shafts, with leaves interlacing, and forming<span class="linenum">1210</span></span>
<span class="i0">Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels.</span>
<span class="i0">Then in the golden weather the maize was husked, and the maidens</span>
<span class="i0">Blushed at each blood-red ear, for that betokened a lover,</span>
<span class="i0">But at the crooked laughed, and called it a thief in the corn-field.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover.<span class="linenum">1215</span></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Patience!&#8221; the priest would say; &#8220;have faith, and thy prayer will be answered!</span>
<span class="i0">Look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,</span>
<span class="i0">See how its leaves are turned to the north, as true as the magnet;</span>
<span class="i0">This is the compass-flower, that the finger of God has planted</span>
<span class="i0">Here in the houseless wild, to direct the traveller&#8217;s journey<span class="linenum">1220</span></span>
<span class="i0">Over the sea-like, pathless, limitless waste of the desert.</span>
<span class="i0">Such in the soul of man is faith. The blossoms of passion,</span>
<span class="i0">Gay and luxuriant flowers, are brighter and fuller fragrance,</span>
<span class="i0">But they beguile us, and lead us astray, and their odour is deadly.</span>
<span class="i0">Only this humble plant can guide us here, and hereafter<span class="linenum">1225</span></span>
<span class="i0">Crown us with asphodel flowers, that are wet with the dews of nepenthe.&#8221;</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">So came the autumn, and passed, and the winter&mdash;yet Gabriel came not;</span>
<span class="i0">Blossomed the opening spring, and the notes of the robin and bluebird</span>
<span class="i0">Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood, yet Gabriel came not.</span>
<span class="i0">But on the breath of the summer winds a rumour was wafted<span class="linenum">1230</span></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeter than song of bird, or hue or odour of blossom.</span>
<span class="i0">Far to the north and east, it said, in the Michigan forests,</span>
<span class="i0">Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the Saginaw River.</span>
<span class="i0">And, with returning guides, that sought the lakes of St. Lawrence,</span>
<span class="i0">Saying a sad farewell, Evangeline went from the Mission.<span class="linenum">1235</span></span>
<span class="i0">When over weary ways, by long and perilous marches,</span>
<span class="i0">She had attained at length the depths of the Michigan forests,</span>
<span class="i0">Found she the hunter&#8217;s lodge deserted and fallen to ruin!</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Thus did the long sad years glide on, and in seasons and places</span>
<span class="i0">Divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden;&mdash;<span class="linenum">1240</span></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Now in the Tents of Grace of the meek Moravian Missions,</span>
<span class="i0">Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of the army,</span>
<span class="i0">Now in secluded hamlets, in towns and populous cities.</span>
<span class="i0">Like a phantom she came, and passed away unremembered.</span>
<span class="i0">Fair was she and young, when in hope began the long journey;<span class="linenum">1245</span></span>
<span class="i0">Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended.</span>
<span class="i0">Each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,</span>
<span class="i0">Leaving behind it, broader and deeper, the gloom and the shadow.</span>
<span class="i0">Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o&#8217;er her forehead.</span>
<span class="i0">Dawn of another life, that broke o&#8217;er her earthly horizon,<span class="linenum">1250</span></span>
<span class="i0">As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning.</span>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware&#8217;s waters,</span>
<span class="i0">Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn the apostle,</span>
<span class="i0">Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded.</span>
<span class="i0">There all the air is balm, and the peach is the emblem of beauty,<span class="linenum">1255</span></span>
<span class="i0">And the streets still reëcho the names of the trees of the forest,</span>
<span class="i0">As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested.</span>
<span class="i0">There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,</span>
<span class="i0">Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.</span>
<span class="i0">There old René Leblanc had died; and when he departed,<span class="linenum">1260</span></span>
<span class="i0">Saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants.</span>
<span class="i0">Something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Something that spake to her heart, and made her no longer a stranger;</span>
<span class="i0">And her ear was pleased with the Thee and Thou of the Quakers,</span>
<span class="i0">For it recalled the past, the old Acadian country,<span class="linenum">1265</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where all men were equal, and all were brothers and sisters.</span>
<span class="i0">So, when the fruitless search, the disappointed endeavour,</span>
<span class="i0">Ended, to recommence no more upon earth, uncomplaining,</span>
<span class="i0">Thither, as leaves to the light, were turned her thoughts and her footsteps.</span>
<span class="i0">As from a mountain&#8217;s top the rainy mists of the morning<span class="linenum">1270</span></span>
<span class="i0">Roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us,</span>
<span class="i0">Sun-illumined, with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,</span>
<span class="i0">So fell the mists from her mind, and she saw the world far below her,</span>
<span class="i0">Dark no longer, but all illumined with love; and the pathway</span>
<span class="i0">Which she had climbed so far, lying smooth and fair in the distance.<span class="linenum">1275</span></span>
<span class="i0">Gabriel was not forgotten. Within her heart was his image,</span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,</span>
<span class="i0">Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence.</span>
<span class="i0">Into her thoughts of him time entered not, for it was not.</span>
<span class="i0">Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;<span class="linenum">1280</span></span>
<span class="i0">He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent;</span>
<span class="i0">Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others,</span>
<span class="i0">This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.</span>
<span class="i0">So was her love diffused, but, like to some odorous spices,</span>
<span class="i0">Suffered no waste nor loss, though filling the air with aroma.<span class="linenum">1285</span></span>
<span class="i0">Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but to follow,</span>
<span class="i0">Meekly with reverent steps, the sacred feet of her Saviour.</span>
<span class="i0">Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy; frequenting</span>
<span class="i0">Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,<span class="linenum">1290</span></span>
<span class="i0">Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected.</span>
<span class="i0">Night after night when the world was asleep, as the watch-man repeated</span>
<span class="i0">Loud, through the gusty streets, that all was well in the city,</span>
<span class="i0">High at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper.</span>
<span class="i0">Day after day, in the gray of the dawn, as slow through the suburbs <span class="linenum">1295</span></span>
<span class="i0">Plodded the German farmer, with flowers and fruits for the market,</span>
<span class="i0">Met he that meek, pale face, returning home from its watchings.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,</span>
<span class="i0">Presaged by wondrous signs, and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,</span>
<span class="i0">Darkening the sun in their flight, with naught in their craws but an acorn.<span class="linenum">1300</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, as the tides of the sea arise in the month of September,</span>
<span class="i0">Flooding some silver stream, till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,</span>
<span class="i0">So death flooded life, and, o&#8217;erflowing its natural margin,</span>
<span class="i0">Spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence.</span>
<span class="i0">Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to charm, the oppressor;<span class="linenum">1305</span></span>
<span class="i0">But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends nor attendants,</span>
<span class="i0">Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the homeless.</span>
<span class="i0">Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of meadows and woodlands;&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Now the city surrounds it; but still, with its gateway and wicket<span class="linenum">1310</span></span>
<span class="i0">Meek, in the midst of splendour, its humble walls seem to echo</span>
<span class="i0">Softly the words of the Lord:&mdash; &#8220;The poor ye always have with you.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i0">Thither, by night and by day, came the Sister of Mercy. The dying</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed, to behold there</span>
<span class="i0">Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendour,<span class="linenum">1315</span></span>
<span class="i0">Such as the artist paints o&#8217;er the brows of saints and apostles,</span>
<span class="i0">Or such as hangs by night o&#8217;er a city seen at a distance.</span>
<span class="i0">Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,</span>
<span class="i0">Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the streets, deserted and silent,<span class="linenum">1320</span></span>
<span class="i0">Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of the almshouse.</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet on the summer air was the odour of flowers in the garden,</span>
<span class="i0">And as she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them.</span>
<span class="i0">That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, as she mounted the stairs to the corridor, cooled by the east-wind,<span class="linenum">1325</span></span>
<span class="i0">Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of Christ Church,</span>
<span class="i0">While, intermingled with these, across the meadows were wafted</span>
<span class="i0">Sounds of psalms, that were sung by the Swedes in their church at Wicaco.</span>
<span class="i0">Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit;</span>
<span class="i0">Something within her said, &#8220;At length thy trials are ended;&#8221;<span class="linenum">1330</span></span>
<span class="i0">And, with light in her looks, she entered the chambers of sickness.</span>
<span class="i0">Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful attendants,</span>
<span class="i0">Moistening the feverish lip, and the aching brow, and in silence</span>
<span class="i0">Closing the sightless eyes of the dead, and concealing their faces,</span>
<span class="i0">Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of snow by the roadside.<span class="linenum">1335</span></span>
<span class="i0">Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline entered,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed, for her presence</span>
<span class="i0">Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison.</span>
<span class="i0">And, as she looked around, she saw how Death, the consoler,</span>
<span class="i0">Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it for ever.<span class="linenum">1340</span></span>
<span class="i0">Many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time;</span>
<span class="i0">Vacant their places were, or filled already by strangers.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Suddenly, as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,</span>
<span class="i0">Still she stood, with her colourless lips apart, while a shudder</span>
<span class="i0">Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the flowerets dropped from her fingers,<span class="linenum">1345</span></span>
<span class="i0">And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning.</span>
<span class="i0">Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,</span>
<span class="i0">That the dying heard it, and started up from their pillows.</span>
<span class="i0">On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man.</span>
<span class="i0">Long, and thin, and gray were the locks that shaded his temples;<span class="linenum">1350</span></span>
<span class="i0">But, as he lay in the morning light, his face for a moment</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood;</span>
<span class="i0">So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying.</span>
<span class="i0">Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,</span>
<span class="i0">As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals.<span class="linenum">1355</span></span>
<span class="i0">That the Angel of Death might see the sign, and pass over.</span>
<span class="i0">Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit exhausted</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,</span>
<span class="i0">Darkness of slumber and death, for ever sinking and sinking.</span>
<span class="i0">Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations,<span class="linenum">1360</span></span>
<span class="i0">Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush that succeeded</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saintlike,</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Gabriel! O my beloved!&#8221; and died away into silence.</span>
<span class="i0">Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home of his childhood;</span>
<span class="i0">Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them,<span class="linenum">1365</span></span>
<span class="i0">Village and mountain, and woodlands; and, walking under their shadow,</span>
<span class="i0">As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in his vision.</span>
<span class="i0">Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eye-lids,</span>
<span class="i0">Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bedside.</span>
<span class="i0">Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered<span class="linenum">1370</span></span>
<span class="i0">Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken.</span>
<span class="i0">Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him,</span>
<span class="i0">Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her bosom.</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it suddenly sank into darkness,</span>
<span class="i0">As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.<span class="linenum">1375</span></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow,</span>
<span class="i0">All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing,</span>
<span class="i0">All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience!</span>
<span class="i0">And as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,</span>
<span class="i0">Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, &#8220;Father, I thank thee!&#8221;<span class="linenum">1380</span></span>

<span class="i5">Still stands the forest primeval; but far away from its shadow,</span>
<span class="i0">Side by side, in their nameless graves, the lovers are sleeping.</span>
<span class="i0">Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard,</span>
<span class="i0">In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and unnoticed.</span>
<span class="i0">Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them.<span class="linenum">1385</span></span>

Thousands of throbbing hearts, where theirs are at rest and for ever,</span>
<span class="i0">Thousands of aching brains, where theirs no longer are busy,</span>
<span class="i0">Thousands of toiling hands, where theirs have ceased from their labours,</span>
<span class="i0">Thousands of weary feet, where theirs have completed their journey!</span>

<span class="i5">Still stands the forest primeval; but under the shade of its branches<span class="linenum">1390</span></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells another race, with other customs and language.</span>
<span class="i0">Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic</span>
<span class="i0">Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers from exile</span>
<span class="i0">Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom.</span>
<span class="i0">In the fisherman&#8217;s cot the wheel and the loom are still busy;<span class="linenum">1395</span></span>
<span class="i0">Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,</span>
<span class="i0">And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline&#8217;s story,</span>
<span class="i0">While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighbouring ocean</span>
<span class="i0">Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.</span>
